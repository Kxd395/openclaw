# Workspace README

This workspace is the "brain" for the Chief of Staff.

Files you should edit carefully:
- SOUL.md: hard rules and operating principles
- USER.md: personal preferences
- HEARTBEAT.md: periodic tasks (keep it short)
- MEMORY.md: curated long-term memory (update only via diffs)

Folders:
- skills/: custom skills
- memory/: daily logs
- knowledge/: ingested sources and notes
- contacts/: relational intelligence artifacts
- backups/: local snapshots and archives
- ops/: helper scripts used by skills and scheduled jobs
