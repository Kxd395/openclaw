---

## Inputs (preferred)

- Today's log: workspace/memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md
- Recent messages and channel transcripts (if available)
- Calendar events in the next 7 days
- Task list artifacts inside the workspace (files, notes)

If inputs are missing, say what you lack and proceed with what exists.

## Phase 1: Draft (lead-analyst)

Produce a short "state of the union" that includes:
- Wins
- Open loops
- Risks
- Next 7 days calendar constraints

All bullets must cite evidence.

## Phase 2: Critique (parallel roles)

Each critic produces at most 3 claims.
Each claim must include:
- evidence pointer
- confidence 0 to 100
- proposed action or decision

Roles:
- growth-strategist: upside and leverage
- skeptical-operator: execution risk and stop list
- revenue-guardian: immediate ROI and cash flow

## Phase 3: Consensus (moderator)

The moderator:
- deduplicates claims
- scores actions using the rubric in AGENTS.md
- outputs a final brief

## Final brief format

- Top 3 changes
- Top 3 next actions (each doable in 30 minutes)
- Stop list (1 to 3 items)

Each bullet includes:
- evidence pointer
- confidence
